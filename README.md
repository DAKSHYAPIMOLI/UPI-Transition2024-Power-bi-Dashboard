# UPI-Transition2024-Power-bi-Dashboard
In 2024 alone, UPI processed billions of transactionsâ€”fueling everything from your morning coffee on Swiggy/Zomato to booking trains on IRCTC and shopping on Amazon.

ðŸ’¡ To dive deeper into this trend, I created an Interactive UPI Transaction Dashboard (2024 Data) using Power BI.

ðŸ“Š Whatâ€™s inside the dashboard?

Gender-based usage trends:
ðŸ‘¨ Male users â†’ higher in utility & banking transfers
ðŸ‘© Female users â†’ more active in e-commerce & quick commerce

Age-group segmentation (â‰¤25, 25â€“35, 35+)

Bank-to-bank transaction flows & city-level adoption

Modes of payment: QR code scans, device-based transfers, direct payments

âœ¨ The dashboard doesnâ€™t just show numbersâ€”it tells a story of how India embraced digital payments across lifestyle, travel, and commerce in 2024.
